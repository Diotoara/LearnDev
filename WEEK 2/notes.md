# create index.html & script.js

# in boiler plat of index.html, write script and scrool to script src="...

# enter script.js in the " ", in script src in html.



# to store variables 
1. var -> old, not used (can use declaration again of same variable)

2. let-> when value is to be change later, like usual variable

3. const-> constant data stored. value can not be changed.

you need not write the data type, just write let or const, then variable name and assign value
eg: let age = 17;
